# Visual Studio Code Extensions

## Highly recommended for C development

- [Microsoft C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)

- [Bracket Pair Colouriser 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)

## Extra Extensions the I use

Listed in order of importance (to me)

1. [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) - The most ***<mark>important</mark>*** editing extension.
2. [Clang-Format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format) - Usable without much trouble on MacOS, requires extra setup for Linux and Windows.
3. [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) No need in 2021 to have spelling mistakes in anything.
4. [GitLens â€” Git supercharged](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)  Git is builtin, but I like the extra information provided by GitLens.
5. [Better C++ Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeff-hykin.better-cpp-syntax) Somewhat deprecated as the MS C extension does some of this.
6. [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) I use for other projects, but won't be seen much in this course code.
